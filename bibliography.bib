  abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation ({SDE}) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time {SDE} that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time {SDE} depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical {SDE} solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time {SDE}. We also derive an equivalent neural {ODE} that samples from the same distribution as the {SDE}, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on {CIFAR}-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and {FID} of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of \$1024{\textbackslash}times 1024\$ images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},
